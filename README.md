# RainCheck 🌧️

This is a text messaging app that will text you the hourly weather. 

All you have to do is text it your zip code and it'll start giving you hourly weather updates daily.

This was a side project to get me familiar with Twilio, as well as give me the hourly weather data I needed in the morning.
